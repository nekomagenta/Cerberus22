# Neural Challenges
This respoitory will contain all challnges I finished.
Most, if not all, will be written in python.

## Challanges:
  ### 1. Guessing game
  Create a guessing game.
  ### 2. Dark Speech Translator
  Create a program that can translate Dark Speech to Common Speech.
  Dark Speech works like this:
  - All words are individually reversed, if it starts with a capital letter, the new first letter will become a capital letter and the old capital letter will become lowercase.
  - All punctuation stays at it's place.
## Special thanks:
  - IamPIYUSH for coming up with the idea of challenge #1
